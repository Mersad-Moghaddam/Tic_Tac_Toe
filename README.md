This project is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game built using Go. It features a user-friendly interface where two players can play against each other or a player can play against an AI agent. The game is implemented using Go's `net/http` package for handling web requests and the `html/template` package for rendering HTML templates.

Key features:
- Two-player mode where users can input their names and take turns playing.
- AI mode with selectable difficulty levels.
- Responsive design with a clean and modern interface.
- Game state management and win detection logic implemented in JavaScript.

The project structure includes:
- 

web.go

: Main Go file that sets up the HTTP server and handles routing.
- 

agent.go

: (Assumed) File that contains the AI agent logic.
- 

go.mod

 and 

go.sum

: Go module files that manage dependencies.

To run the project, use the following command:
```sh
go run web.go
```

The server will start at 

http://localhost:8000

, where you can access the Tic Tac Toe game.
